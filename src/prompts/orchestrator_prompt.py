#                 - Read the context, take your time to understand, see if there were many tasks and if you executed them all
#                 - If there are no actions to be taken, then make the action "respond_to_user" with your final thoughts combining all previous responses as input.
#                 - Respond with "respond_to_user" only when there are no agents to select from or there is no next_action
#                 - You will return the agent name in the form of {response_format}
#                 - Always return valid JSON like {response_format} and nothing else.
